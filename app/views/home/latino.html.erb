                In July of 2016, DreamFunded.com launched the first equity crowdfunding platform in the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley. DreamFunded helps small businesses by providing access to loans of up to $1 million. Not only that but because of changes in the law, you can only use a website like DreamFunded to allow everyone to financially support your businesses. It’s a completely new type of banking system that makes it easier for small business owners to grow. Now as an established website, we are launching a latino-focused initiative to help elevate businesses in the latino community but we need your participation.
